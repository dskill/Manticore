# Dead Balls

A horror bowling game created during the 48-hour [Molyjam](http://www.molyjam.com/) game jam.

## About

Dead Balls is a Unity3D bowling game where players roll balls at animated pins in a spooky atmosphere. The game was inspired by the tweet: *"Imagine survival horror mixed with bowling"* and represents a creative interpretation of combining two seemingly incompatible genres.

Originally released for free on the iOS App Store in 2012.
