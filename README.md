# Dead Balls

A horror bowling game created during the 48-hour [Molyjam](http://www.molyjam.com/) game jam.

## About

Dead Balls is a Unity3D bowling game where players roll balls at animated pins in a spooky atmosphere. The game was inspired by the tweet: *"Imagine survival horror mixed with bowling"* and represents a creative interpretation of combining two seemingly incompatible genres.

Originally released for free on the iOS App Store in 2012, this project is a historical artifact from an experimental game jam that pushed the boundaries of unconventional game design.

## Technical Details

This is a legacy Unity project (circa 2012) that has been updated for Unity 2019 compatibility. The original game code and assets remain largely unchanged except where required for modern Unity API compatibility.

## Historical Context

Dead Balls represents an early era of experimental mobile gaming and game jam culture. The 48-hour development constraint led to creative technical and design decisions that are preserved in this codebase. This repository serves as a time capsule of indie game development practices from the early 2010s.
